HOMEWORK: JS libraries Hackathon!
Explore - Play - Fiddle
Pick one of the libraries below and build something cool with it! This time, don’t worry about a strict plan, just make sure that whatever you do build, you have something to present by the end!  
Chances are quite high that you’ve never worked with or seen these libraries before - perfect! Once you pick a library you want to use, we strongly recommend you find a ‘getting started’ guide, or a tutorial to walk you through an example first. Then look back, modify, make something your own, customize.
What you should get out of this exercise:
Ability to get up and running quickly with a new technology


Broadened view of what you are currently capable of building, what’s possible


Exposure to different coding philosophies, structures, and patterns


Become more comfortable with reading documentation, diving into something unfamiliar


Fun
Pick one (only one) library to use:
Chartjs (charts)
Flotjs (charts)
P5js (visuals)
Threejs (3d)
Slickjs (carousel)
EaselJS + TweenJS (animation)
Trackingjs (camera Tracking)
Howlerjs (audio)
Bootstrap (CSS)
Leafletjs (maps)
Firebasejs (hosted database)
Bandjs (audio)
Aframevr (virtual reality)
Anything else.
Getting started:

Do a little bit a research, and pick one library from the list above. Then learn how to use the library, use "the getting started", or follow a tutorial. Then customize what you made to be something unique or interesting. Make sure your idea / theme is still professional and does not have anything inappropriate. 
Caution:
Do NOT follow parts of any instructions that say use “npm install”, “npm i ..”,“bower install”, “yarn install” - or have any kind of “import” / "export" statements in the code (unless you’re comfortable with them). We’ll learn about those later, but for now, you’ll bring the libraries in using script tags e.g. your HTML. You’ll likely need to download those javascript library files to your computer and link them in your HTML like you would any other JS file. Look for directions that show you what to put in your script tag. In some cases you’ll just have to find the github repo.
